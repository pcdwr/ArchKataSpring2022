## Exexutive Summary

>"The Spotlight App Project is a sustained effort to amass a coalition of
nonprofits in order to address specific needs within the communities we serve by leveraging a
centralized platform as the base of operations to collaborate and make a collective impact."

* Archikers proposes to build and deliver flexible, maintainable, scalable and extensible platform to
    * Provide centralized avenue for Non-profits to deliver services
    * Promote collaboration among Non-profits as well as between Non-profits & candidates
    * Increase visibility and accessibility of services to aspiring candidates 
    * Provide capability to raise any issues related to service and getting the resolution
* Proposed solution is going to be secure, highly available and cost-effective meeting Non-profit current and future operational need

## Requirement Understanding

## High level Use cases

## Business and Architecture Principles

The following principles will drive the Spotlight Platform architecture and build.
### Business Principle
* Build matching decision based on user preference, Not demand-supply
To recommend matching, System will higher weighatge to user preference and Non-profit service offering attributes than ratinga & demand-supply 
* Collaboration is the key 
System will promote higher level of collaboration among system users (Non-Profits, Candidates and Administrators)

Every data attributes, use action, and interaction will be captured by system and will be used to generate insight. Which will promote better pridiction, matching and visibility
* Ease of use
System will be easy to use by different persona's on different devices
### Architecture Principle 
* Microservice architecture 
System will be loosely coupled, extensible, scalable and easily maintainable. Microservice Architecuture will be followed
* 12 Factor App priciple
System will be built using 12 factor app principle
* Responsive Web Design (RWD)
User interface will be built using RWD principle allowing it to be render in different devices like desktop, tablet, mobile
