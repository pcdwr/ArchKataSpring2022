# Apple Store

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Should we create and distribute an iOS app?

## Decision
UI development will be done in Flutter which supports native iOS development. While it is possible to create and distribute the app, for the MVP this has been ruled out as it still requires significant effort to obtain licenses and credentials for publishing in the App Store.

## Consequences

### Pros
Reduced development time and effort.

### Cons
Mobile phone represent a large potential customer base as many of the potential members may have to choose between a phone and a computer.
